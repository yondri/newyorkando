AdSense Now! gets you started with Google AdSense. No mess, no fuss. Simplest Google AdSense plugin.

== Description ==

*AdSense Now!* is the simplest possible way to generate revenue from your blog using Google AdSense. Aiming at simplicity, *AdSense Now!* does only one thing: it puts your AdSense code in up to three spots in your posts and pages (both existing ones and those yet to be written).

= Features =

1. AdSense Now! enforces the Google policy of not more than three adsense blocks per page.
1. AdSense Now! sports the simplest possible configuration interface -- nothing more than cutting and pasting AdSense code.
1. AdSense Now! gives you an option to suppress ads on all pages (as opposed to posts), or on the front/home page, category/tag/archive listings.
1. AdSense Now! lets you control the positioning and display of AdSense blocks in each post or page.
1. AdSense Now! is internationalized with multiple languages supported.

PS: You'll need a [Google AdSense Account](http://adsense.google.com/).

*AdSense Now!* is the freely distributed version of a premium plugin. The [Pro version](http://buy.ads-ez.com/adsense-now/ "Pro version of the AdSense Now! plugin for only $3.95") gives you more control. It gives you filter to ensure that your ads show only on those pages that seem to comply with Google AdSense policies, which can be important since some comments may render your pages inconsistent with those policies. It also lets you specify a list of computers where your ads will not be shown, in order to prevent accidental clicks on your own ads -- one of the main reasons AdSense bans you. These features will minimize your chance of getting banned.

= New in this Release =

Compatibility with WP3.6.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.40 =

Compatibility with WP3.6.

1. How to set the options for *AdSense Now!*

== Installation ==

1. Upload the *AdSense Now!* plugin (the whole adsense-now-lite folder) to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Setup -> AdSense Now! and enter your AdSense code and options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I get a "Plugin does not have valid header" error? =

This seems to be a problem with some WordPress installations. I have never been able to reproduce this error on any of my installations. I have found [this on the web](http://webdesign.anmari.com/2312/activation-error-plugin-does-not-have-valid-header-still-activates/ "This may give you some ideas") though.

= What are the different versions of the plugin? =

AdSense Now is the freely distributed version of a premium plugin. The [Pro version](https://buy.thulasidas.com/adsense-now "Pro version of the AdSense Now plugin") gives you more benefits -- lets you activate a filter to ensure that your ads show only on those pages that seem to comply with Google AdSense policies. It also lets you specify a list of computers where your ads will not be shown, in order to prevent accidental clicks on your own ads -- one of the main reasons AdSense bans you. These features will minimize your chance of getting banned. The Pro version costs $3.95, and is appropriate if you expect to make more than $100 of ad revenue from your site.

= How can I contact the plugin author if I need help? =

This plugin uses a paid support model in order to manage the support load. Each [support ticket](http://support.thulasidas.com "Ask a support question") will be charged at $0.95 for the Lite version (and for the Pro version after a short free support period). The support ticket is valid for 48 hours, and further follow-up questions will call for a new support ticket.

= I still don't get it. Porn and site block - that you already have during Asdense ad setup? =

What you have in AdSense is an ability to block ads from certain sites. For instance, if you don't like ads *from* my site "thulasidas.com", you can block them. What the pro version gives you is the ability to block ads *to* certain clients. That is, if you don't want visitors from certain IP addresses see your ads (because they may click on too many of them, getting your AdSense account banned, for instance), you can with my plugin.

Porn block also is similar -- Google lets you choose non-porn ads (I think). What my plugin does is to look at the content of your page, and block ads if it looks like a porn page. (This can happen if a spammer posts a porn kind of comment on your blog, which again may get your AdSense account banned.)

= How can I control the appearance of the adsense blocks using CSS? =

All `<div>`s that *AdSense Now!* creates have the class attribute `adsense`. Furthermore, they have attributes like `adsense-leadin`, `adsense-midtext` and `adsense-leadout` depending on the type. You can set the style for these classes in your theme `style.css` to control their appearance.

= Why another AdSense plugin? =

The other plugin I have published, [Easy AdSense](http://buy.ads-ez.com/easy-adsense "The complete solution for all things AdSense related"), does everything that *AdSense Now!* does and more. But in doing so, Easy AdSense has become an All-in-One AdSense plugin, and not "Easy" any more. I wanted to go back to the basics and provide a simple plugin to get our fellow bloggers started on AdSense.

= I like its simplicity, but *AdSense Now!* doesn't have all the features I need. Can you add *this* and *that* feature? =

If you think *AdSense Now!* is too lean and mean for your taste, try my full-fledged, feature-rich plugin [Easy AdSense](http://buy.ads-ez.com/easy-adsense "The complete solution for all things AdSense related"). I plan to keep *AdSense Now!* simple.

= I just activated the plugin. How come I don't see any ads in my blog? =

Note that you have to generate your adsense code from Google, and paste the *entire* code in the text box, replacing the existing text. Changing the publisher id alone is not good enough.

If you just created the new Google AdSense code, it may not be active yet. Google takes about ten minutes or so before serving ads. Please try again later.

= Can I control how the adsense blocks are formatted in each page? =

Yes! Now, in V1.1+, you have more options (using [Custom Fields](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields "Scroll down to the section titled Usage")) to control adsense blocks in individual posts/pages. Add custom fields with keys like `adsense-top`, `adsense-middle`, `adsense-bottom`, `adsense-widget`, `adsense-search` and with values like `left`, `right`, `center` or `no` to have control how the Google adsense blocks show up in each post or page. A Custom Field `adsense` with  value `no` suppresses all AdSense ad blocks in the post or page.

= How do I report a bug or ask a question? =

Please report any problems, and share your thoughts and comments [at the plugin forum at WordPress](http://wordpress.org/tags/adsense-now-lite "Post comments/suggestions/bugs on the WordPress.org forum. [Requires login/registration]") Or [contact me](http://support.thulasidas.com/ "Contact Manoj").

**If you have a question or comment about the Pro version, please do not use the forum hosted at WordPress.org, but [contact the plugin author](http://support.thulasidas.com/ "Contact Manoj") using our support portal.**
