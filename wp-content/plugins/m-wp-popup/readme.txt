WP Popup plugin is beautifully designed and elegant plugin with focus on ease of use and functionality. Create unlimited Popups with subscriber forms 

== Description ==

After the frustration with the existing popup plugins I decided to create a new WordPress Popup plugin from scratch named <strong>WP Popup Plugin</strong> and after months of development and hard work the first version is ready Please download the plugin and use it on your site and let me know your <a href="http://rocketplugins.com/contact/">feedback</a>. I hope you'll also love my plugin like I do.

There are no major functionality compromises made in the free version of the plugin but you have to purchase the <a href="http://rocketplugins.com/wordpress-popup-plugin/">premium version</a> of the plugin to get extra rules, extra email services are supported like aweber, campaign monitor and themes like HTML theme which will let you show any kind of valid HTML content inside the popup be it videos, forms, images etc. Two really beautiful and high converting popup themes with subscriber forms are included in the <a href="http://rocketplugins.com/wordpress-popup-plugin/">premium version</a>
